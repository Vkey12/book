I don't just want anyone.
I want someone who wants that movie type love
sitting in the cinema wide eyed at the front.
I want a partner who's my person but also my
best friend.
so...
let me love you like a cinema,
a film I never want to end.
Bring you flowers in the rain
just cos you hadn't seen them 
for a little while.
You said dahlia were your favorite 
so I picked them up to make you smile.
I want someone who will stay.
I want a lifetime till grayer days.
I want that place in the pines 
we can raise our little names.   
So...
Give me candle lit dinners
speaking softly and old blues.
You can talk to me slow when I
chew your thoughts, that land 
sweeter than soul food.
