You existed in my life, but you were never really there.
In your neglect, I became the child who learned to survive,
but never knew how to feel loved.
In your silence, I became a teenager who pretended everything was fine,
even when i was falling apart inside.
The teenager who locked her heart away,
too scared it would break if she let anyone in.
In your absence, I became the young woman who
searched for love in all the wrong places,
because I didn't know how to give myself.
Without you, I finally saw my worth and loved myself,
because I learned I didn't need anyone to make me feel
whole but myself.
