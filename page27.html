I've survived and I am not stronger for it.

I am not proud to wear the scars,
they are a reminder of the pain I've endured.
although my body has healed,
my mind still bleeds like they are fresh.

People around me have become so tired of the
same story and I don't even tell it anymore.
I wish they understood that I'm tired too.
tired of pretending that I'm okay,
and that "time heals all wounds" (it doesn't)

The trauma literally changed my brain.
overstimulated amygdala,
underactive hippocampus,
weak prefrontal cortex.

I've survived and I am not stronger for it.
