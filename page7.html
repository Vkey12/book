They say what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger,
but it only left me scared.
Scared of getting close,
because people always seem to take more than they give.
Scared of trusting,
because trust always ends in broken pieces.
Scared of loving,
because love has always felt 
like a gamble I'm destined to lose.
Trauma didn't make me brave;
it made me afraid to try,
because trying has always felt
like the first step toward breaking.
