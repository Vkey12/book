I want to buy you the world,
but I don't have any cash
I spent it all way too fast,
and I would sell all my dreams,
just for you my love,to buy you
shiny fancy things

I want to give you my heart.
I mean you already have it,
but i'd duplicate it and give you another
and you can hang it on your wall.
...or maybe stuff it under your mattress or something.
