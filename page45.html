March remind me that time is
marching on, and the colors in the
tress remind me that spring is here,
even though you are not.
And the earth reminds me that the
flowers don't stop from springing 
because my heart is still in winter.
Life doesn't wait for us 
and neither does death.
Both are ready whenever they are
ready whether we are or not.
The world will keep moving on even 
when I haven't.
And the season will change even 
when I don't want to accept them.
And time is marching on regardless of if 
I like it or not.
And it's up to me to choose whether 
I remain halted or decide to march on with it.
