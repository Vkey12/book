I thought growing up
would mean leaving the past behind,
but I still feel like her,
the little girl who stayed quiet,
who didn't ask for anything
because she knew the answer would be no.
I still carry her fears,
her loneliness,
her need to prove
she's worth loving.
And no matter how much I grow,
she's always there,
waiting for someone to tell her
she's enough.
