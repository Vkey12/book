I want you to love me.
But tell me how you love yourself first.
Tell me how you hold yourself through the hurricanes,
when grayer days seem their worst,
Or how do you celebrate your little wins,
your little things on this little earth.

I want you to ask me about my day,
but first tell me about yours.
Tell me how you sat in silence for 60 seconds
to find a lesson in your own words,
a smaller moment of reflection
self-love for 60 seconds.
How coffee in bed was more than
just a cup from French pressing.

Tell me how you love yourself in a relationship,
or how you love yourself when you're single.
How do you lean into what you love 
until your eyes find a twinkle.
I want you to grow old with yourself
alongside smile lines and wrinkles.
And I hope you want that to.
Cause everything you love about yourself
is what I love best about you.
