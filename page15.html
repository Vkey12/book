We all wanna be someone's favourite person,
someone's reason, someone's best memory,
maybe we just want proof that we matter,
that our existance left something behind,
that someone out there sees as the way we 
hoped to be seen.

Maybe that's all love is, being noticed.
staying unforgetable, you don't need to prove your
worth to anyone who refuses to see it.
If someone refuses to see you for who you are,
then they never wanted you to grow in the first place.
You are allowed to exist outside of who people expect you to be.

You can learn so much about yourself, just by paying attention
to how you feel when you're around certain people, 
the ones who make you feel lighter, the ones who leave
you drained, the ones who remind you of who you are.
Energy never lies, but its up to you whether you listen.
You are still allowed to want more, 
even if your life is good right now.
