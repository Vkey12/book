If you are looking for forever,
i'll take the batteries of my clocks.
So that we'll be stuck inside this moment 
as if time had really stopped.
                
I would tell you I love you
every second, except here, 
seconds do not exist.
So i'll say I love you with each breath,
with each smile, with each kiss.
                
And when I die, you can crank your watch,
restart your clocks, begin the time.
And know that we were infinite
in the moment that you were mine.
