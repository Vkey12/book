Healing can feel like being in a maze.
You bump into the same walls and
take the same turns, thinking you're
going nowhere.
But really, each step, each turn,
is leading you closer to the exit.

Some days, you'll feel stuck,
like the walls are closing in,
and you'll question why you're even trying.
But every mistake, every step back,
is just another lesson,
another piece of the puzzle that's
falling into place.

It's okay to not have it all figured out,
to feel lost and confused.
You're finding your way,
even when it doesn't feel like it.
Each time you stand back up,
you're one step closer to freedom,
to the person you're meant to be.

So keep moving,
even when it feels like you're going nowhere.
Don't stop now, you're closer than you think.
