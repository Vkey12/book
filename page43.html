They tell me love will come
when I least expect it.
But how do you stop expecting 
something you've been dreaming of
your whole life?
I've watched love bloom in the life of others 
seeing it take shape in quiet glances and 
hands reaching for each other without thinking.

I've seen whats like to be chosen,
to be held, and to be loved so raw
and have wondered when it will be my turn.
But love is not something you chase,
it's something you prepare for, and so
i'll wait, not in longing,not in loneliness,
but in becoming the kind of person who 
doesn't settle for almost, who doesn't 
beg to be seen, who know that love
when it arrives, will be worth every 
second of waiting. 

And until then, I'll keep loving life,
loving myself, and loving the possibility 
that when love comes, It will find me
well prepared.
