You've done well.
I know you always don't see it 
the time between one challenge and the next
has been too small to celebrate
but you should.
                
Because look at you, 
all the things you've overcome,
all the battles you fought,
all the days you got through
when you weren't sure you could,
you don't give yourself enough credit.
                
you see the struggles but not how they shaped you.
you focus on the weight of it all,
but not how much stronger you've become carrying it.
Every small win,
every  quiet victory,
every time you kept going 
when you wanted to stop.
                
Those moment weren't meaningless
they were building you.
And now here you are,
standing with more wisdom (wisdom kweliðŸ˜‚)
more resilience, more courage
than you've ever had before.
                
So take a second,
Let yourself be proud.
You are doing better
than you think you are.
                
And no matter what comes next,
already proven, you'll find a way through.
