I'm standing here watching
me lose the love of my life and it's
like a bad dream that I can't wake up from.
I've been up all night playing the best parts
of us in my mind like it will bring you home, but i
was so unaware of what you leaving actually meant.
you said goodbye, but i heard i love you.

I know eventually we won't see each other again...
we'll stop talking and you'll always feel too far away.
the thought of you forgetting me is terrifying,
but i want you to know that i'll still think of you on
your birthday because no matter what,
you will always be someone i want to celebrate.

I smile knowing there will be a day
that i'll still wonder how you are,
and maybe you'll be out there
doing the same.

We weren't meant to be forever,
We were just meant to be.
