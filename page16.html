My childhood trauma didn't make me stronger,
it made me believe that I could only be loved
by fixing everything around me.

I learned to be the quiet one,
the people pleaser,
hoping that if I was enough for everyone else,
someone would finally see me.
But no matter how hard I tried,
I was never enough for myself.
I thought if I could give more,
If I could please enough people,
maybe I'd earn the love I was starving for.

I've spent my whole life thinking
that my worth was something I had to prove,
that love was something I had to work for,
even if it meant losing myself along the way.
