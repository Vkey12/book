You remind me of my favorite color.
the part of the movie i'll always love.
the page of the book that's folded at the corner.
you are everything that i never want to forget
and the reason i want to remember.

It's like i'm dreaming with my eyes open.
i'm falling and it's not something i need to
heal from because you are the calm that my
storm has been waiting for.

They call it the honeymoon phase, but
there's nothing temporary about
the way i feel about you.

I have on your t-shirt
and you're wearing my socks...
nothing feels like forever
more than that.
