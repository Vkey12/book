I know I haven't always been
the best at responding to text messages,
at calling you back,
at making sure you know just 
how much you mean to me.

But please don't mistake 
my silence for my absence.
I think of you more often than you know
I wonder how you are doing,
and if life is treating you kindly,
if you've had a reason to smile today.

Time moves too fast 
and one day turns into a week,
a week turns into a month
and before I realize that it's 
been too long since we last spoke,
shared a meal, a lough, a piece of life together.

I want to be better,
to be more intentional,to call more,
to remember birthdays, to celebrate your wins
to remind you while you're 
still here to hear it, that you are loved.

But please be patient with me 
some lessons take longer to learn than others
and this one for me has been hard to grasp.

But if you remember nothing else,
remember this, I love you
I admire our friendship and
i'm doing my best to make sure we never 
become strangers.
