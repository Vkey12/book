I replay your voice in my head day after day
because i never want to forget what
it sounds like when you say my name.

I wish love would've been enough to save us
because I had so much more to give,
but you didn't know how to hold it
and i didn't know when to quit.

if i'm being honest, i'll never feel this way
about anyone else because there's a part of me
that won't ever know how to stop loving you.
like muscle memory, I do it without even trying.

I miss you in a desperate kind of way.
I miss you like you're just gone for the weekend
and i'll see you on sunday.

Maybe in another lifetime
i know when to let go.
Maybe in another lifetime
i don't need to.
