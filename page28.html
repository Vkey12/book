I saw your text,
the text that said if we can just "talk,"
but I knew it wasn't really about talking.
It was about you wanting me to stay
in the same cycle we've been in,
asking me to relive the pain
because you didn't know how to let go.
You never asked if I was okay,
or how I was doing,
just if I was still willing to be there
when it suited you.

But this time I'm done.
I don't need to hold onto the past
just to prove I loved you.
I've learned that I am worth more
than the scraps you offer.

I'm choosing myself now,
I won't keep chasing someone
who was never really there.
It's time to give myself the love
you never could.
