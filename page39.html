My brain is in a mess tonight
you are still here
but my heart is already aching
I can't stop asking myself
how long more before you go?
I know deep down
I don't have you anymore
and I am not okay with it
there's a million things
I want to say to you
but I don't know where to begin
I have a feeling
whatever I say
will end up to be wrong
and I will just push you further away
I wish I could read your mind 
but i think i already know
what your answer is
