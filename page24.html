                Damn right I'm angry.

I've spent my life recovering from things
that I should have been protected from.

I was too young to become a ghost full of grief,
children are supposed to be happy and free.

don't tell me I wouldn't be who I am today,
without all the struggles I faced.

I already know that. I could have been a kid
instead of being forced to grow up.

The people who were supposed to protect me,
failed me. no amount of healing will change that.

Damn right I'm angry,
I'll never get my childhood back.
