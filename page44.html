What a strange thing,
having a bundle of feelings
and nowhere to place them.
So you just have to carry them.

If I gave them to you where I want them
to belong, you would throw them out, or 
forget to buy a vase to put them in.
And if some miraculous reason you did have
a vase, and you did put them in it,
I know I would sit there and dry up
slowly. Until my favorites part crinkled 
up and fell apart. And you wouldn't 
even notice they were missing because
you never saw them to begin with.

There is a probably insane piece of
me that would let it happen. 
I'd light up your room until I couldn't
anymore just to be in your presence.
To have a spot on your table.
But I know better--
and I know I should keep carrying these feelings
until I find someone who will take them
and grow gardens with them.
