I know it feels like a lot right now,
like the world is asking too much,
like you mind won't quiet down,
like the weight of everything is pressing
in a little too close. 
But you're okay,
even if you don't feel like it yet,
even if the road ahead seems a bit shaky,
you're okay.
                
So breathe, let yourself rest in the 
truth that you're loved,that you're enough,
that you don't have to have all the answers today.
I'm proud of you for showing up, for trying,
for making it this far. You are doing better than 
you think. No matter What comes next
you don't have to face it alone.
I'm here,
I'm not going anywhe
