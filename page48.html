In case no one's reminded you lately--
they didn't stay, but that doesn't mean
you weren't worth staying for.

love isn't meant to make you beg,
break, or question your own worth.

one day, someone will choose you in
all the ways they couldn't, and when
that day comes, you'll understand it was
never that you were too much.
They were just never enough.
