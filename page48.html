But you deserve to be loved like
a habit and not like a chore.
You deserve to have someone 
sprint to your door, someone 
to kiss you willingly on
you forehead. 
You deserve for your TikTok repost 
to become your reality.
Because you are so much more 
worth than being someone's 'maybe'.
You deserve someone that catches you 
when you full on sprint into their arms for a long hug.
You deserve someone that dances 
with you in the kitchen without 
feeling embarrassed at all.
Someone who thinks you are beautiful
with your bed head.
Someone that will show up with your
favorite snacks on a bad day.
You deserve that.
Not someone complaining that 
you're asking for the bare minimum
because they are too lazy and don't feel
like giving you something that they full
on decided to commit to months ago
when they were obsessed with the idea 
of you.
So I'm telling you that you deserve flowers,
kisses, love letters.
You deserve effort and real love,
not having to be on your knees at his
feet every night begging for it.
