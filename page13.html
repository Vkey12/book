Have you ever tasted something 
so good so warm so rich 
that you have to close your eyes
just to take it in?
That's what loving you 
feels like.
                
If love had a flavour, it'd be you.
Sweet like honey, warm like today's bread,
something i'd never get tired of.
Your voice is rain on a hot day
your touch sweetest the morning after,
I didn't know love could feel this.
                
Not like a chase, not like a question,
but soft and steady, I don't have to wonder
where I stand with you. I don't have
to shrink myself or overthink every word,
or earn your affection like a prize.
                
You love me in a way like I prayed
for when I was a kid. and I wanna love
you the same way.
Not with silence, not in secret, but out loud
in full colour, without fear, without doubts,
because love like this doesn't happen everyday
and I wouldn't waste a single second of it.
