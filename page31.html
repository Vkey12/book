I keep writing about you,
as if ink could hold you closer than my arms.
As if words are gonna burn through.
As if I could rewrite the ending into something sweeter.

I keep writing about you.
Because this love in my heart is too
large for ribcages to contain,
too big to be said in a sentence,
too heavy to stay locked inside.

I keep writing about you,
as if i'm trying to fill a void,
as if i'm deluding myself that you are not absent,
as if letters could bring you to me.

I keep writing about you.
Until your name becomes a 
language only I can understand.
Until the papers turn into a 
graveyard, for all the things I never said.

And i'll keep writing about you.
Because silence kills me.
Because writing about you is like breathing,
I can't force myself to stop.
