There is a kind of sweetness
in loving someone from afar.
For on that distance 
their image is perfect.
Untouched by reality's weight.
How strange it is to love someone
who becomes the very fabric of your being,
yet remains a stranger in the waking hours of your life. 
Where their absence feels like presence,
and their presence feels like a dream too fragile to hold.
With each passing day
I am reminded of the bitter truth,
the more I cherish this image of you,
the more unreachable you become.
Some loves are not meant to be shared,
only cherished in the silence of the heart
and though you may never know
this love has filled every corner of my being.
