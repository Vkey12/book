If I could I would cut my love
into a million tiny pieces and toss 
them onto you like confetti.
Watch each one shower over you 
and land on you in a million 
colorful ways.

If I could I would etch our initials
into every tree, except there are not
enough trees to declare my love for you
so i'll have to settle for pressing poems
into paper, little tattoos of what you 
mean to me.
And if there was an ink well the size of 
the five oceans, it still wouldn't be enough
to say everything I want to say to you,
and I love you is just a combination of letters,
and syllables, and vowels, and consonants.
And I could write them. I could speak them,
I could translate them into every language 
and none of it would be enough.

So maybe I should just tell you to measure 
my love for you in numbers and you'd never 
stop counting.
And forever is still only a fraction 
when it comes to my feelings for you.
