There are two types of friends.
The first kind is so loud you just have to notice
and then there's you, 
your light shines differently,
it's soft and intimate.
It doesn't demand attention,
it offers comfort.
That's the kind of friend you are.

Stay, you're enough, to me you're home,
It's how you make a space feel whole 
just by being in it. I feel safe with you,
free, that's all i'll ever need.
