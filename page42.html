My friends say I deserve to be happy. 
That i should find someone who sees me,
who understands the way my mind works,
who holds my love with steady hands,
and I think they are right,
I do deserve that.

Whatever time love gets too close
I push it away.
Not with force, but with hesitation.
Like i'm waiting for it to prove it 
won't last. Maybe i'm not ready.
Maybe they are not ready. Maybe I 
spent so much time watching love slip 
through my fingers I don't trust it to stay.

Maybe I just don't trust myself, to 
hold on without breaking it.
Because what if they are too good
for me? What if i'm just a temporary
home? 
A place they rest until they find better.
Find safer, find easier.

But then again, maybe not.
Maybe love isn't something I have to grip
so tightly to. 
Maybe is not about holding on
is about letting it hold on to me.
Maybe I should give it a chance.
Unlock the door to my heart,
not standing outside wondering if
I belong inside.
Maybe I should just walk in.
