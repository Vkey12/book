In the chapters of life pain
will always hold a page.
And sometimes the process of progress
is an uncomfortable phase.
But...
once you read through the writing you'll 
see the lighter days are just a chapter away.
But, while you're in the middle of 
it all don't pretend to be okay
cos...
Sometimes the sad feels 
better than feeling good.
So let it stay.
Let it stay where you
spend a smile with a friend.
The ones who hold you in a 
home without charging you rent.
the ones that know you are alone
from the way you pick up the phone,
that lower tone that you own they hear it,
cos they're heavenly sent.
Yeah how often when you get the down days
and just spin them with a smile.
If only we spoke for a while
we'd see that beings are wild
and that feeling like seasons
will go and change with the time.
So, love all of you including the 
sad parts of your mind
