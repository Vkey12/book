I'd like to think that time has 
reserved a place for us.
Some simpler time where it 
did work out. And the world
didn't seem so against the 
idea of you and I.
And maybe in that time we find ourselves
under a thatched roof cottage.
The one you always wanted.
The one that we call 'Ours'.
And maybe in the evenings.
We take turns to cook for each other.
To play Chef. Often cooking in silence.
For we know that sound lives and dies within it.
And sometimes it's wondrous to celebrate that.
Maybe a Doberman named Daisy
curled up in the corner who's left
paw was trodden on as a pup and
now walks a little funny. But..
her undying tenacity to still
live life to the fullest
serves us a constant reminder 
that we must play on with the hand
we're dealt.
A time reserved.
