You convince yourself you are difficult
to love, but the soul says...
maybe you've just spent too much time
with people who never knew how to love you.
                
The way you treat yourself in your own head
will always matter more than the way anyone else
treats you. You can't force yourself to stop
feeling something just because you know it 
isn't good for you. 
                
Some emotions don't disappear, they just change shape. 
You don't have to fight them, just learn to live alongside them.
You can't make people see you the way you wish they would,
you either accept how they see you, or you walk away.
                
Some people don't realize they've hurt you because 
they were never paying enough attention to notice
they matter to you. You can spend your whole life 
waiting for an apology, or you can accept that some people 
live without ever seeing the damage they cause.
You will never be able to make someone stay who 
doesn't want to, and you shouldn't have to convince them.
