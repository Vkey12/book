What you should know about me is that I will love
you through every season. I am the kind of person 
who will help you bury your worries under the
snow and dig them back up when you're ready 
to face them again. I will plant seeds in all of the 
places it hurts because flowers help make anything 
better and spring is just around the coner waiting
to show you that hope still lives here. Maybe it's 
true that when it rains it pours, but that just means
there will be a rainbow on the horizon ready for 
you to see it, and if you start to fall, you can lean
in my direction because I promise i'm not going
anywhere unless it's with you.
