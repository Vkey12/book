                A Heavy Gift

The devil couldn't reach me,
so he cursed me instead.
He placed in my chest a heart
that beats too loud,
feels too much,
and never learns.

It cares for hands that push it away,
it aches for voices
that never call back,
it bleeds for strangers
who don't even glance my way.

The devil couldn't reach me,
but he didn't need to.
He knew a heart like this
would tear itself apart
and call it love.
