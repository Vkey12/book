I didn't forgive you for youâ€•
I forgave you for me.
Because holding onto the hurt
meant living in the prison
you built for me.

But forgiving isn't forgetting.
I remember every word that cut,
every silence that screamed louder than anger.
I remember the nights
I held myself together
because you didn't.

I carry those memories,
not to keep the pain alive,
but to remind myself
of what I survived.
They don't make me bitter,
they make me stronger.
Because now I know
what love should never feel like.
